        <p>Lorna is flying back home to the UK. Ideally, she would like to fly in directly to her
            home town of Glasgow. Edinburgh is her second choice and, if necessary, she could fly
            into London and pick up an internal connecting flight. Although she has been offered a
            cheap flight to Manchester it remains her least favourite option as connecting flights
            to Glasgow are not very reliable from there.</p>
